**(책 요약) Quantitative Finance with Python (Chapter 1 - Setting the Stage; Quant Landscape)**

## 핵심 내용
- *All Models are Wrong, Some are Useful.*
- Players in quants
   - **Sell side**: *Dealers & Market Makers (create derivative structures and exotic options)*
   - **Buy side**: *Asset Managers & Hedge Funds (main goal is to deliver strong investment returns)*
   - *Buy-side institutions often reach out to dealers with a desired structure, and the dealer responds with pricing.*
- *The majority of most quant problem is trying to understand the underlying distribution of assets.*
- Commoditization of Factor Premias
   - investment_return == beta * market_benchmark + alpha
   - Identification of additional factors, or risk premia, such as carry, value, momentum, (low) volatility and quality, which used to be classified as alpha, have become another type of beta.
