**(논문 요약) FAST: Efficient Action Tokenization for Vision-Language-Action Models** [(Paper)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09747)


## 핵심 내용
- 문제 의식: *robot action tokenization, based on simple per-dimension, per-timestep binning schemes, typically perform poorly when learning dexterous skills from high-frequency robot data.*

- Frequency-space Action Sequence Tokenization (FAST): compression-based tokenization scheme for robot actions, based on the Discrete Cosine Transform
