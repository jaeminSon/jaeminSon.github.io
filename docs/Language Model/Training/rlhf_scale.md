**(논문 요약) DOES RLHF SCALE? EXPLORING THE IMPACTS FROM DATA, MODEL, AND METHOD** [(Paper)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06000)

## 핵심 내용
- *Increasing data diversity and volume improves reward model performance.*
- *More response samples per prompt boost performance initially but quickly plateau.* 
- *Larger reward models offer modest gains in policy training.* 
- *Larger policy models benefit less from RLHF with a fixed reward model.*
