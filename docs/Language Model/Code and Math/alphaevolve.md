## Achievement
- more efficient scheduling algorithm for data centers
- functionally equivalent simplification in the circuit design of hardware accelerators
- accelerated the training of the LLM underpinning AlphaEvolve itself
- search algorithm that found a procedure to multiply two 4 × 4 complex-valued matrices using 48 scalar multiplications
