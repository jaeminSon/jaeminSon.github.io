**(논문 요약) Kosmos: An AI Scientist for Autonomous Discovery** [(Paper)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02824)

## 핵심 내용
- Kosmos pursues the specified objective,
   - over 200 agent rollouts
   - collectively executing an average of 42,000 lines of code
   - reading 1,500 papers per run

- Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature, ensuring its reasoning is traceable. 
   
- Kosmos orchestrates “LLMs” powering a data-analysis agent and a literature-search agent (no specific model names or vendors provided).

- Independent scientists found 79.4% of statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate.

- Collaborators reported that a single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own research time on average.
