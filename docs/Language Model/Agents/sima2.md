## 핵심 내용
- Initial learning: human demonstrations
- Subsequent training: *SIMA 2’s own experience data can then be used to train the next, even more capable version of the agent.*
   - Gemini provided an initial task and an estimated reward for SIMA 2's behavior.
   - The agent uses these for further training in subsequent generations improving on previously failed tasks.
