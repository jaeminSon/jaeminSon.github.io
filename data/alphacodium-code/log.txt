Your goal is to come up with possible solutions to the code contest problem.

Guidelines:
- Make sure each solution fully addresses the problem goals, constraints, examples, and notes.
- Each solution must have reasonable runtime and memory complexity - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large inputs.
- Double-check the solutions. Each possible solution must be able to generalize to additional test cases, not just the ones provided in the problem description.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $ProblemSolutions, according to the following Pydantic definitions:

    We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. Here are the steps:

    1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements as 0. dp[i] will store the number of arrays of length i that satisfy the conditions.

    2. Set dp[1] = a[1] because for an array of length 1, all a[1] numbers are valid.

    3. For each i from 2 to n, calculate dp[i] as follows:
       - First, we can choose any number from 1 to a[i] for b[i] which is not equal to b[i-1]. This gives us (a[i] - 1) * dp[i-1] possibilities.
       - Second, we can choose any number from 1 to a[i-1] for b[i] which is equal to b[i-1]. This gives us a[i-1] * dp[i-2] possibilities.
       - So, dp[i] = (a[i] - 1) * dp[i-1] + a[i-1] * dp[i-2].

    4. The answer is dp[n] modulo 998244353.

    This approach works because it counts all possible arrays of length i that satisfy the conditions by considering all possible last elements and the number of ways to form the rest of the array.

    The time complexity is O(n) because we are processing each element of the array once. The space complexity is also O(n) because we are storing the number of ways for each length in the dp array.
  why_it_works: |
    This solution works because it systematically counts all possible arrays that satisfy the conditions. It uses dynamic programming to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and solve them. By considering all possible last elements and the number of ways to form the rest of the array, it ensures that all valid arrays are counted. The use of modulo operation ensures that the result stays within the range of integer data type.

Your task is to generate additional 6 diverse input-output examples for the code contest problem.
Try to cover cases that are not covered by the original tests. Also include a test for large inputs.
The generated tests should be sorted by difficulty, from easiest to hardest.
All the inputs should be valid, and the outputs are correct. Double check them, and validate they match the problem description and rules.

The output must be a valid YAML object equivalent to type $ProblemTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
======
class Test(BaseModel):
    input: str
    output: str
    explanation: str = Field(description='Short explanation how we got the output from the input. Be specific')

class ProblemTests(BaseModel):
    tests: List[Test] = Field(min_items=6, max_items=6)
======


Example YAML output:
```yaml
tests:
- input: |
    ...
  output: |
    ...
  explanation: |
    ...

You are given a code contest problem, and a self-reflection on the problem.


problem description:
=============
You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of n positive integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n such that: 

  * 1 ≤ b_i ≤ a_i for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), and 
  * b_i ≠ b_{i+1} for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1). 



The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353 in a single line.

In the second test case possible arrays are [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1] and [2, 3].
=============


self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about finding the number of possible arrays that can be formed from a given array of positive integers, following certain rules.

- The first rule is that each element in the new array must be a positive integer and less than or equal to the corresponding element in the original array.

- The second rule is that no two adjacent elements in the new array can be the same.

- The length of the original array is given as input, followed by the elements of the array.

- The output should be the number of possible arrays that can be formed, modulo 998244353, to handle potentially large numbers.

- The problem constraints specify that the length of the array can be up to 200,000 and each element in the array can be up to 1 billion.

Your goal is to generate a valid Python code that correctly solves the code contest problem, using the following algorithm:
=============
name: "Dynamic Programming Approach"
content: |
  We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. Here are the steps:

  1. Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements as 0. dp[i] will store the number of arrays of length i that satisfy the conditions.

  2. Set dp[1] = a[1] because for an array of length 1, all a[1] numbers are valid.

  3. For each i from 2 to n, calculate dp[i] as follows:
     - First, we can choose any number from 1 to a[i] for b[i] which is not equal to b[i-1]. This gives us (a[i] - 1) * dp[i-1] possibilities.
     - Second, we can choose any number from 1 to a[i-1] for b[i] which is equal to b[i-1]. This gives us a[i-1] * dp[i-2] possibilities.
     - So, dp[i] = (a[i] - 1) * dp[i-1] + a[i-1] * dp[i-2].

  4. The answer is dp[n] modulo 998244353.

  This approach works because it counts all possible arrays of length i that satisfy the conditions by considering all possible last elements and the number of ways to form the rest of the array.

  The time complexity is O(n) because we are processing each element of the array once. The space complexity is also O(n) because we are storing the number of ways for each length in the dp array.
why: |
  This solution works because it systematically counts all possible arrays that satisfy the conditions. It uses dynamic programming to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and solve them. By considering all possible last elements and the number of ways to form the rest of the array, it ensures that all valid arrays are counted. The use of modulo operation ensures that the result stays within the range of integer data type.

Guidelines:
- You must divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Variables names should also be meaningful.
- Double-check the generated code. It should generalize to any valid input, and not just the provided examples.
- Make sure to include all the necessary module imports, properly initialize the variables, and address the problem constraints.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.



The generated code must follow this structure:
```
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

Guidelines:
- You must divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Variables names should also be meaningful.
- Double-check the generated code. It should generalize to any valid input, and not just the provided examples.
- Make sure to include all the necessary module imports, properly initialize the variables, and address the problem constraints.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.



The generated code must follow this structure:
```
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

You are given a code contest problem, and a self-reflection on the problem.


problem description:
=============
You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of n positive integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n such that: 

  * 1 ≤ b_i ≤ a_i for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), and 
  * b_i ≠ b_{i+1} for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1). 



The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353 in a single line.

In the second test case possible arrays are [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1] and [2, 3].
=============


self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about finding the number of possible arrays that can be formed from a given array of positive integers, following certain rules.

- The first rule is that each element in the new array must be a positive integer and less than or equal to the corresponding element in the original array.

- The second rule is that no two adjacent elements in the new array can be the same.

- The length of the original array is given as input, followed by the elements of the array.

- The output should be the number of possible arrays that can be formed, modulo 998244353, to handle potentially large numbers.

- The problem constraints specify that the length of the array can be up to 200,000 and each element in the array can be up to 1 billion.

You are given a code contest problem, and a self-reflection on the problem.


problem description:
=============
You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of n positive integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n such that: 

  * 1 ≤ b_i ≤ a_i for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), and 
  * b_i ≠ b_{i+1} for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1). 



The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353 in a single line.

Note

In the first test case possible arrays are [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 2].

In the second test case possible arrays are [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1] and [2, 3].
=============


self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about finding the number of possible arrays that can be formed from a given array of positive integers, following certain rules.

- The first rule is that each element in the new array must be a positive integer and less than or equal to the corresponding element in the original array.

- The second rule is that no two adjacent elements in the new array can be the same.

- The length of the original array is given as input, followed by the elements of the array.

- The output should be the number of possible arrays that can be formed, modulo 998244353, to handle potentially large numbers.

- The problem constraints specify that the length of the array can be up to 200,000 and each element in the array can be up to 1 billion.

Your goal is to generate a valid Python code that correctly solves the code contest problem, using the following algorithm:

Set dp[1] = a[1] because for an array of length 1, all a[1] numbers are valid.\n\n3. For each i from 2 to n, calculate dp[i] as follows:\n   - First, we can choose any number from 1 to a[i] for b[i] which is not equal to b[i-1].

Guidelines:
- You must divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Variables names should also be meaningful.
- Double-check the generated code. It should generalize to any valid input, and not just the provided examples.
- Make sure to include all the necessary module imports, properly initialize the variables, and address the problem constraints.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.



The generated code must follow this structure:
```
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

You are given a code contest problem, and a self-reflection on the problem:


problem description:
======
You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of n positive integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n such that: 

  * 1 ≤ b_i ≤ a_i for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), and 
  * b_i ≠ b_{i+1} for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1). 



The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353 in a single line.

self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about finding the number of possible arrays that can be formed from a given array of positive integers, following certain rules.

- The first rule is that each element in the new array must be a positive integer and less than or equal to the corresponding element in the original array.

- The second rule is that no two adjacent elements in the new array can be the same.

- The length of the original array is given as input, followed by the elements of the array.

- The output should be the number of possible arrays that can be formed, modulo 998244353, to handle potentially large numbers.

- The problem constraints specify that the length of the array can be up to 200,000 and each element in the array can be up to 1 billion.

Your goal is to analyze the code solution and the error, and propose a fix so the code will produce the expected output for the provided test input.

  The original solution failed to correctly calculate the number of possible arrays. The error in the code is in the dynamic programming transition. The original code uses (a[i - 1] - 1) * dp[i - 1] + a[i - 2] * dp[i - 2] as the transition, which is incorrect. This formula does not correctly account for the condition that no two adjacent elements in the new array can be the same.

  - Initialize a dynamic programming (dp) array of size n+1 with all elements as 0. dp[i] represents the number of possible arrays of length i.
  - Set dp[1] as a[0] because there is only one possible array of length 1, which is [a[0]].
  - For each i from 2 to n, calculate dp[i] as follows:
    - First, calculate the number of possible arrays of length i-1 where the last element is not equal to a[i-1]. This can be done by multiplying dp[i-1] with (a[i-1]-1).

Using the analysis above, you need to generate a fixed solution code, that will pass all the tests.

- Make sure the new solution code generalizes to all possible input-output examples, not just the provided input-output examples.

problem description:
======
You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of n positive integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n such that: 

  * 1 ≤ b_i ≤ a_i for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), and 
  * b_i ≠ b_{i+1} for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1). 



The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353 in a single line.

self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about finding the number of possible arrays that can be formed from a given array of positive integers, following certain rules.

- The first rule is that each element in the new array must be a positive integer and less than or equal to the corresponding element in the original array.

- The second rule is that no two adjacent elements in the new array can be the same.

- The length of the original array is given as input, followed by the elements of the array.

- The output should be the number of possible arrays that can be formed, modulo 998244353, to handle potentially large numbers.

- The problem constraints specify that the length of the array can be up to 200,000 and each element in the array can be up to 1 billion.

  The initial code solution incorrectly calculates the number of possible arrays. The problem lies in the dynamic programming approach used, specifically in the formula for calculating dp[i]. The formula does not correctly account for the rule that no two adjacent elements in the new array can be the same. The current formula calculates dp[i] as the product of a[i - 1] and dp[i - 1], plus the product of (a[i - 1] - 1) and dp[i - 2]. This does not correctly implement the rule that no two adjacent elements can be the same.

  - Initialize a variable MOD to 998244353.
  - Initialize an array dp of size n + 1 with all elements as 0. This array will be used to store the number of possible arrays for each length from 0 to n.
  - Set dp[0] to 1, as there is only one possible array of length 0 (the empty array).
  - For each i from 1 to n, calculate dp[i] as follows:
    - If i is 1, set dp[i] to a[0], as there are a[0] possible arrays of length 1.
    - If i is greater than 1, calculate dp[i] as the sum of two terms:
      - The first term is the product of a[i - 1] and dp[i - 1], modulo MOD. This represents the number of arrays of length i where the last two elements are different.

You are given a code contest problem:
=============
You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of n positive integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n such that: 

  * 1 ≤ b_i ≤ a_i for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), and 
  * b_i ≠ b_{i+1} for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1). 



The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353 in a single line.

Using all the information above, your goal is generate a fixed code solution, that will pass the test.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedCode, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class FixedCode(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: str = Field(description="List the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Describe shortly, in bullet points, what went wrong with the previous solutions.")
    fixed_flow: str = Field(description="Describe a fixed flow leading to the correct solution, in pseudo-code. Be specific and detailed.")
    fixed_code: str = Field(description="A fixed code solution. Don't explain your answer. Just provide the code itself, and nothing else")
=====

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |
  ...
what_went_wrong: |
  ...
fixed_flow: |
  ...
fixed_code: |
  ...
```

Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- Divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Keep the code simple and short.
- The fixed code should be robust and general, and work for other input examples as well
- Double-check the new solution code, and make sure it is correct and complete.
- The fixed code must have a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large input.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.

  - {input: "3\n1 2 3\n", expected_output: "4\n", code_output: "Error message"}
what_went_wrong: |
  - The code is trying to calculate the number of possible arrays by using a dynamic programming approach. However, the formula used in the dp array is incorrect and does not follow the problem's constraints.
  - The code is trying to subtract the previous two dp values which is not correct according to the problem's constraints.
fixed_flow: |
  - Initialize a MOD variable with value 998244353.
  - Initialize a dp array of size n+1 with all values as 1. This is because for each element in the array, there is at least one possible array (the array itself).
  - For each element in the array from index 1 to n, calculate the number of possible arrays by multiplying the current dp value with the current element in the array and taking modulo MOD. This is because for each element, we can either choose it or not choose it, hence multiplying the current dp value with the current element.
  - Return the last value in the dp array as the result.

  - Initialize the MOD constant and the dp list.
  - Set the first element of dp to 1 as there is only one way to form an array with one element.

    - Calculate dp[i] as the product of a[i-1] and dp[i-1] minus the product of a[i-2] and dp[i-2] plus dp[i-1], all modulo MOD.
    - This calculation is based on the problem's constraints: each element in the new array must be less than or equal to the corresponding element in the original array and different from its adjacent elements.
  - Return the last element of dp as it represents the number of possible arrays modulo MOD.

You are given a code contest problem:
=============
You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of n positive integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n such that: 

  * 1 ≤ b_i ≤ a_i for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), and 
  * b_i ≠ b_{i+1} for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1). 



The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353 in a single line.

Using all the information above, your goal is generate a fixed code solution, that will pass the test.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedCode, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class FixedCode(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: str = Field(description="List the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Describe shortly, in bullet points, what went wrong with the previous solutions.")
    fixed_flow: str = Field(description="Describe a fixed flow leading to the correct solution, in pseudo-code. Be specific and detailed.")
    fixed_code: str = Field(description="A fixed code solution. Don't explain your answer. Just provide the code itself, and nothing else")
=====

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |
  ...
what_went_wrong: |
  ...
fixed_flow: |
  ...
fixed_code: |
  ...
```

Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- Divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Keep the code simple and short.
- The fixed code should be robust and general, and work for other input examples as well
- Double-check the new solution code, and make sure it is correct and complete.
- The fixed code must have a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large input.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.

- The fixed code must have a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large input.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.

You are given a code contest problem:
=============
You are given an array of n positive integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n. Your task is to calculate the number of arrays of n positive integers b_1, b_2, …, b_n such that: 

  * 1 ≤ b_i ≤ a_i for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), and 
  * b_i ≠ b_{i+1} for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n - 1). 



The number of such arrays can be very large, so print it modulo 998 244 353.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) — the length of the array a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

Output

Print the answer modulo 998 244 353 in a single line.
=============


A Python code solution was generated for the problem:
=============
def calculate_possible_arrays(n, a):
    MOD = 998244353
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = a[0]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = ((a[i - 1] * dp[i - 1]) % MOD - ((a[i - 2]) * dp[i - 2]) % MOD + dp[i - 1]) % MOD
    return dp[n]

def parse_input():
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    return n, a

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, a = parse_input()
    print(calculate_possible_arrays(n, a))
=============


However, when running the input-output example test, the code solution failed to produce the expected output, and gave the following error message:

=============


Using all the information above, your goal is generate a fixed code solution, that will pass the test.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedCode, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class FixedCode(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: str = Field(description="List the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Describe shortly, in bullet points, what went wrong with the previous solutions.")
    fixed_flow: str = Field(description="Describe a fixed flow leading to the correct solution, in pseudo-code. Be specific and detailed.")
    fixed_code: str = Field(description="A fixed code solution. Don't explain your answer. Just provide the code itself, and nothing else")
=====

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |
  ...
what_went_wrong: |
  ...
fixed_flow: |
  ...
fixed_code: |
  ...
```

Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- Divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Keep the code simple and short.
- The fixed code should be robust and general, and work for other input examples as well
- Double-check the new solution code, and make sure it is correct and complete.
- The fixed code must have a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large input.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.

what_went_wrong: |
  - The original code was trying to calculate the number of arrays by using a dynamic programming approach. However, it was not correctly calculating the number of possible arrays.
  - The original code was not handling the case where a[i] is less than a[i-1] correctly.
fixed_flow: |
  - Initialize a MOD constant to 998244353.
  - Create a function to calculate the factorial of a number modulo MOD.
  - Create a function to calculate the number of possible arrays. This function should iterate over the array, and for each element, it should multiply the current result by the factorial of the element modulo MOD.
  - In the main function, parse the input, call the function to calculate the number of possible arrays, and print the result.
